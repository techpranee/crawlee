## Sample Scraped Data

### Result #1: Monumental - Robotics Company
```json
{
  "postText": "MONUMENTAL | https://www.monumental.co/ | Amsterdam, The Netherlands | Full Time | Onsite
  
We're creating robots that autonomously construct buildings. We design all of our hardware 
and software in-house in central Amsterdam, and we're starting with autonomous bricklaying robots.

We have built a machine vision pipeline that can achieve sub-millimetre localisation on 
construction sites, and a neat software stack that lets us configure and control robots with ease. 
We're deploying our robots on real construction sites and have started making the first revenue 
from our bricklaying-as-a-service model.

The software team is now nine people (~35 people overall), and continuing to grow. There's strong 
customer demand for what we're building, and we're starting to scale up robot production to meet it.

Our stack is mostly: Rust, TypeScript, Python, NixOS.

Interested in getting your hands (sometimes literally) dirty solving interesting problems? 
Have a look at our open roles:
- Software Engineer, Controls
- Software Engineer, Machine Vision
- Other: assembly/manufacturing/electronics technicians, robot operators, workshop lead

## Campaign Configuration

### Successful Configuration (HackerNews)
```json
{
  "name": "HackerNews Who is Hiring - October 2025",
  "source": "custom",
  "mode": "crawlee",
  "output": "database",
  "strategy": "cheerio",
  "maxItems": 50,
  "seedUrls": ["https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41709301"],
  "selectors": {
    "postText": ".comment",
    "author": ".hnuser",
    "postDate": ".age",
    "postId": ".athing"
  }
}
```

### Key Learnings
1. **Authentication-free sources work best** for initial testing
2. **Cheerio strategy** is faster for static HTML pages
3. **Custom selectors** allow targeted data extraction
4. **HackerNews** is a reliable, publicly accessible source for hiring data
5. **LinkedIn** requires authentication cookies to access content

## Next Steps

### To Get More Results
1. **Increase maxItems:** Set to higher value (e.g., 200) to scrape more posts
2. **Add more seed URLs:** Include additional HackerNews hiring threads
3. **Alternative sources:**
   - GitHub Jobs
   - Remote job boards (RemoteOK, WeWorkRemotely)
   - Company career pages
   - Reddit r/hiring threads

### To Extract LinkedIn Data
1. Add LinkedIn authentication cookies to tenant configuration
2. Use `auth: "linkedin"` in campaign config
3. Configure appropriate rate limiting to avoid blocks

### To Process Results
The raw data can be:
- Exported to CSV via export endpoint
- Normalized into Company/Contact models
- Enriched with additional data
- Analyzed for trends and insights
